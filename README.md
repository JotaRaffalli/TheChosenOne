**The Chosen One** is an app I made that uses [BAsCET](https://everything2.com/title/BAsCET) Artificial Intelligence principle architecture
to choose an item from the list based on it's  temperature levels (weights), trying to imitate the actual human behavior of preference with some ***fate's help***.

You can pretty much use it to make a decision between alternatives of any kind and select how much you want certain item to be chosen. It is still pretty random, so do not worry of biased selections.

Could say it is just another way to make a weighted random, but I wanted to make things more interesting and use some of the literature written by 
[Melanie Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanie_Mitchell) in her awarded [Copycat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copycat_(software)) thesis. 

## Tech under the hood
The piece of code is written in a Object Oriented way with modern vanilla JavaScript modules to manipulate the DOM and the core functionalities.
The app saves items in *local storage* to keep adding stuff if you decide to close it. It allows you to randomly select an item based on the weights of the ratings given.
It uses ES6 modules such as classes, arrows, destructuring assignments, scoped and constant variables.

## What I practice 
  - ES6 syntax
  - Local Storage
  - Copycat Architecture
